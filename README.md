# F1 Dublin Race Ticket Booking System

## Introduction

Welcome to the coding repository dedicated to the F1 Dublin City Grand Prix website; A website which not only provides details about a made up street track located in Dublin City, Ireland, but also allows users to book tickets for the event.

The project is very relevant as Formula 1 is an increasingly popular sport, frequently looking to add new race locations and the flexibility of the website ensures that its design can be utilised for any event that requires booking a ticket in advance.
